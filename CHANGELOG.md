# Changelog

All notable changes to `cybercore` are documented in this file.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- `cybercore-theme check` reports text, accent, border, and focus contrast for
  dark and light appearance; `--strict` requires every check to pass and an
  explicit light palette. `validate-pack` checks portable bundles before use.
- Theme-pack metadata now supports pack release, license, homepage, Cybercore
  compatibility, and validated color previews while old format-1 packs remain
  readable.
- Consumer compatibility workflow tests Cyberdeck Hub, Cyberdesk, DaemonHall,
  Dockspace, and Cyberterm on a weekly schedule or by manual dispatch.
- Shared component styles now include action buttons, navigation, cards,
  alerts, form fields, visible keyboard focus, and reduced-motion behavior.
- Web consumers receive shared-catalog change events; Cyberterm refreshes only
  when the catalog revision changes.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- `cybercore::theme`: versioned portable theme documents, validation,
  dark/light palette variants, allowlisted design tokens, contrast reports,
  CSS generation, built-in family metadata, shared storage, and safe theme-pack
  import/export.
- `cybercore-theme-studio` workspace binary: standalone local visual editor
  with library selection, CRUD, dark/light editing, import/export, preview,
  and contrast feedback.
- Theme Studio's curated pack library can copy reviewed built-in families into
  the user's catalog with isolated IDs, leaving built-ins and active selection
  untouched.
- Web consumers sync shared theme changes while running; Cyberterm refreshes
  its catalog while running.
- Release-gate tests validate every embedded theme and assert the shared
  component CSS contract. CI checks the declared Rust 1.85 minimum alongside
  stable.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- CI now checks, lints, and tests every workspace package so Theme Studio is
  included in the standard Actions workflow.
- `status` feature: the Cybercore tool status contract (`schema/status.json`)
  and `cybercore::status`, with `ToolStatus`, `Health`, `Metric`, `Event`,
  `Action` and atomic `write` / `write_in`, plus `read`, `path`, `dir` and
  `validate_tool_name`.
  - Status files live in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cybercore/<tool>.json`, falling
    back to `$HOME/.local/state/cybercore/status/`. There is no shared `/tmp`
    fallback. On Unix the directory is `0700` and files are `0600`.
  - Each write goes to a unique temporary file opened with `create_new`
    (existing files and symlinks are never followed), is synced, and is
    renamed into place. Tool names are restricted to letters, digits, `-` and
    `_`.
  - Off by default, so cybercore without `status` still depends only on serde.
- `publish_status` example (`--features status`).

### Added

- `components` module and `css/cybercomponents.css`: shared cards, status
  badges, data tables, form inputs, popup viewers and the theme-picker
  dropdown, coloured entirely from the active CYBERGRID theme.
- Brand assets (logos, header art, favicon, social card) under `assets/`.

### Fixed

- Removed a global `main {}` rule from the component CSS that broke the
  layout of every cyberdesk page.

### Changed

- Minimum supported Rust version is now **1.85**. 0.4.x declared 1.70, but
  its dependencies (serde, syn) no longer build on Rust 1.70, so the old value
  was not achievable.
- README: depend on `cybercore = "0.5"` from crates.io instead of a git tag.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- Metadata patch: repository and homepage links point to
  `github.com/cybercore-tech/cybercore`. No code changes from 0.4.0.

Earlier releases are tagged in Git (`v0.1.0` to `v0.4.0`).
